            <p> New York City has been grappling with oversized classrooms for decades, and while for decades, advocates have pushed to make classrooms smaller, 
                it wasn't until 2022, when Governor Hochul enacted Chapter 556 of the Laws of 2022. This legislation requires the New York City school district 
                to create a five-year class size reduction plan for all New York City K-12 community districts and high schools.

               <p> These neighborhoods in New York City are predominantly made up of Black and Brown families, which has an impact on the graduation rates for Black and 
                Brown students. While poverty is linked to lower graduation rates, other factors also contribute to these disparities, including inadequate education 
                funding that fails to address the specific needs of racially marginalized communities.</p>
